# 💫 About Me:
I am a second-year Artificial Intelligence & Data Science undergraduate with a strong interest in data-driven problem solving and building a solid foundation in core computer science concepts.<br><br>My learning focus revolves around Data Structures & Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Operating Systems, and Artificial Intelligence fundamentals. I enjoy understanding how systems work internally and applying structured thinking to solve logical and analytical problems.<br><br>I am actively developing skills in Data Science and Data Analysis, including working with SQL/MySQL, Python, statistics, and introductory machine learning concepts. Alongside academics, I work on small projects and practice problem-solving to strengthen both conceptual clarity and practical understanding.<br><br>I believe in learning step-by-step, building strong fundamentals first, and continuously improving through practice. My long-term goal is to grow into a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, contributing to impactful, data-driven solutions in real-world applications.<br><br>I am currently focused on skill-building, academic excellence, and project-based learning, and I am open to internships and learning opportunities that help me grow in a collaborative and professional environment.
